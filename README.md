# Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
In this assignment I assisted a Colorado board of elections employee in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. I was tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate and county, the percentage of votes for each candidate and county, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

# Election-Audit Summary: 
This script could be further enhanced to estimate the votes that were cast by gender. This could be useful in seeing which gender voted most for which candidate and in which county. To get the gender count, a gender column would need to be first added to the dataset. Then, inside the for loop, we can count the votes by gender by iterating through the rows.   

Another idea would be to check for duplicate ballot IDs in the first column of the CSV file. Instead of the csv reader function, we could convert this file into a dataframe and use the following code: df.drop_duplicates(subset=['ID'], inplace=True)

This script could also be modified to account for historical election data. We may have a dataset with votes for different years, where we could prompt the user for input: input = "Please enter the year for which you would like to see the election results, enter 2018, 2019, or 2020"
